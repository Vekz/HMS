simple Hospital Management System | Project for Algorithms and Data Structures class @ IPVC

Description from the instruction provided by Salvador Lima (owner of all intellectual property of it):

"[...]The hospital provides specialized health services to people in family medicine,
cardiology, physiotherapy, otorhinolaryngology and nutrition. Each specialist health
service has a specialist doctor
This project mainly uses data manipulation to perform basic operations such as adding,
editing, searching and deleting records of patients and health professionals (doctors).
The main features of the project sont:
1) Healthcare Professional: each doctor has an internal number of healthcare
professional in the hospital, full name, age, name of the medical specialty, number
of years of professional experience, location, telephone, salary and working hours;
2) Patient: each patient has an internal patient number in the hospital, full name,
identification number, age, gender, location, telephone, health problem, date of first
consultation, date of last consultation, date of next consultation, clinical condition,
name of doctor and medical specialty;
The user as administrator of the Management System is responsible for creating the
admission form for health professionals (doctors).
The user as a healthcare professional (doctor) can perform all operations as follows
Add: any clinician can add the details by entering the patient's name, disease
name, phone number, etc.
Edit: any clinician can edit your patients' information;
Remove: any clinician can delete records of their deactivated patients.
and View: any clinician can view all your patients' records;
All details that are related to the patient can be searched by their name and
personal identification number.
The application must comply with the following functional scheme (see next page).
You can add new requirements to the project, provided that their inclusion is justified

DEVELOPMENT
In addition to the reflection necessary for the (re)structuring of the proposed solution to
the problem, the assessment factors will include the structuring of the C source code
(data structures, modularisation, pointers, syntax and semantics of sentences, etc),
the quality of the C programming exercise (executable, error-free and functional code),
the user interface, the fully efficient execution and the quality of the proposed additional
requirements.[...]"
